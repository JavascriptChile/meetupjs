## Getting started ##

### Install ###

    npm install

### Configuration ###

No additional configuration is needed. Installation should take care of any dependencies required to run the site.

### Running the project in localhost ###

This project uses Webpack-dev-server for local development, so just run this to set it up:

    npm start

### Dependencies ###

This site uses React, React-Router and Webpack *(amongst others)* as its main dependencies, but npm install should take care of everything. If you run into any problems, please open an issue so we can look at it, or submit a PR.

### Tests ###

No tests available at the moment. Feel free to contribute with some ;)

### Contributions ###

####Summary####

If you find a bug or wanna help us create the next big cool feature, feel free to open a PR. We'll be more than happy to review it and include it.

####Where do I start?####

Just clone the repo and create a branch. We have simple naming conventions, so if you're fixing something that's broken:

    fix/clear-description-of-what-you-are-doing

If you're building something new:

    feature/same-as-above

####Commits and PR####

Please be clear in your commit messages. Use a short and clear message to describe what that commit does. Example:

    Fix scrolling issues with mobile devices

This will help you identify whatever your PR is about and have a better context for our code review.

PR submission messages on the other hand, should be as clear as possible, so feel free to describe what's the problem and how this commit fixes it.

####Coding conventions####

None at the moment, just look at the project and try to follow along, so it's easier for the rest to understand what you're doing.

####Anything else?####

Yeah, have fun :D
